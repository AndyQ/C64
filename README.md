## A Commodore 64 Emulator for iPad.
## Almost Like the Real Thing.

C64 is an open source emulator for the 8 bit home computer [Commodore 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64). It is based on [Vice](http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net), which provices accurate emulation of many hardware variants and peripherals.

It aims to approximate the feeling of using actual hardware: 
- Rather than configuring abstract settings, you select hardware components.
- The software keyboard is a faccimile of the original, reflecting the different existing styles.
- Even the noise of the disk drive is emulated.

The **Library** section offers a way to organize a large collection of games, demos and programs. The emulated hardware can be customized for each entry.

The **Inbox** provides a place to quickly try new programs. You can easily move the ones you want to keep to the library.

**Tools** mode allows attaching a cartridge like Action Replay or Final Cartridge and a collection of disks with your favorite tools, to help you dig into the programs, like back in the day.

Since the App Store does not allow emulators, you will have to build and install it yourself. You will need Xcode and a developer certificate. C64 has no external dependencies.
